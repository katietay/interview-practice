# Interview Practice

Practice problems for technical coding assessments, organized by programming language.

## About This Repository

This repository contains practice problems for coding interviews. Each problem includes:
- Detailed problem description
- Example inputs and outputs
- Edge cases to consider
- Starter code with function signatures
- Test files

## Structure
```

├── python/          # Python problems
├── cpp/             # C++ problems
└── ruby/            # Ruby problems
```

## Assessment Format

**What to expect:**
- 3 problems total (30-45 minutes)
- 1 problem in Python
- 1 problem in C++
- 1 problem in Ruby
- Each problem has its own timer
- Can use documentation and search engines

**Key evaluation criteria:**
- Clean, readable code
- Edge case handling
- Problem-solving approach
- Ability to break down complexity
- Testing as you go

## Problems Included

### Python
1. **Valid Palindrome** - String manipulation, two-pointer technique
2. **Two Sum** - Hash map usage, array operations

### C++
1. **Sort with Custom Comparator** - Sorting, comparators, structs
2. **Reverse Words in String** - String manipulation, space handling

### Ruby
1. **Character Frequency Counter** - Hash operations, string processing
2. **Group Anagrams** - Hash grouping, sorting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Choose a problem to work on
3. Read the `problem.md` file
4. Implement your solution in the `solution.*` file
5. Test using the `test.*` file
6. Time yourself (aim for 10-15 minutes per problem)

## Tips

- Start simple, then iterate
- Handle edge cases
- Write readable code over clever code
- Test frequently
- Explain your approach out loud
