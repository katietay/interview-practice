Deck of Cards System
Problem: Design and implement a deck of playing cards that can be shuffled and dealt. You should be able to create a deck, shuffle it, and deal cards from it.
Requirements:

Create a Card class with suit and rank
Create a Deck class that contains 52 cards
Implement shuffle functionality
Implement dealing cards (removing from deck)
Keep track of remaining cards

Bonus extensions (if time allows):

Create a Hand class for a player's cards
Implement a simple game like "War" or "Blackjack"
Handle edge cases (dealing from empty deck, etc.)

This is great for showing:

Class design and responsibilities
Encapsulation
Object interaction
Ruby idioms (attr_reader, initialize, etc.)
